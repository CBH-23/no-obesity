## The Why:
Having a background in childrenâ€™s nursing, my goal is to raise awareness and inspire action to combat childhood obesity. This project serves as an educational resource to empower families and communities to make healthier choices.
Say NO TO CHILDREN'S OBESITY. Say Nobesity!

As a teacher or health professional, I want to access trustworthy resources to support childrenâ€™s health.

As a user, I want to navigate the site easily on all devices.
