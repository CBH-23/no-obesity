    <h1>What is Childhood Obesity?</h1>
    <p>
        Childhood obesity is a medical condition where excess body fat negatively impacts a child's health or well-being. In the UK, it is typically assessed using the Body Mass Index (BMI) adjusted for a child's age and sex. Children with a BMI at or above the 95th percentile are classified as obese.
    </p>

    <h2>Health Risks</h2>
    <p>
        Obese children are at a higher risk of developing several chronic conditions, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
        <li>High blood pressure</li>
        <li>Sleep apnoea</li>
        <li>Joint problems</li>
        <li>Low self-esteem and depression</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <p>
        Childhood obesity is caused by a combination of factors, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Poor diet (high in sugar, fat, and processed foods)</li>
        <li>Physical inactivity (excessive screen time, lack of exercise)</li>
        <li>Genetic predisposition</li>
        <li>Environmental and socio-economic factors</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prevention and Management</h2>
    <p>
        Preventing and managing childhood obesity involves a holistic approach:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encouraging a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li>
        <li>Promoting at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily</li>
        <li>Limiting sugary drinks and snacks</li>
        <li>Creating supportive environments at home, in schools, and in communities</li>
        <li>Involving healthcare professionals when needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UK Government Initiatives</h2>
    <p>
        The UK government has introduced several initiatives such as the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/healthier-families/">NHS Better Health â€“ Healthier Families</a> campaign and restrictions on junk food advertising to help combat childhood obesity.
